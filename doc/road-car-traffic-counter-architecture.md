# Architecture Document

## System Overview
The Road Car Traffic Counter / Detection System is designed to process video input from a USB camera, detect and count vehicles in real time, and provide analytics for traffic management.

## Components
1. **Camera Input Module**
   - Captures video stream from USB camera/webcam using OpenCV.
2. **Detection Module**
   - Uses YOLOv11 (Ultralytics, https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) for state-of-the-art, real-time vehicle detection.
   - Integrates with Python and OpenCV for fast inference.
   - Supports pre-trained models and custom training for specific datasets.
3. **Counting & Tracking Module**
   - Tracks vehicles and counts them as they cross a virtual line or region.
   - Uses centroid tracking or multi-object tracking algorithms (e.g., SORT, DeepSORT).
4. **Visualization & UI/UX Module**
   - Built with Plotly Dash (Python) for the interactive dashboard
   - Displays live video, detection overlays, vehicle counts, and analytics
   - Provides configuration panels for detection zones and system parameters
   - Uses Dash Bootstrap Components for responsive design
   - Integrates directly with backend logic and OpenCV
5. **Data Logging Module**
   - Stores traffic counts, detection logs, and optionally annotated frames.
   - Supports local storage (CSV, SQLite).
6. **Configuration Module**
   - Allows users to set detection zones, counting lines, and system parameters.

## Data Flow
- Video stream → YOLOv11 Detection → Tracking/Counting → Visualization & Logging

## Technology Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLOv11 (Ultralytics)
- Plotly Dash (for UI/UX dashboard)
- Dash Bootstrap Components (for UI styling)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- USB camera/webcam
- Local storage (CSV, SQLite)

## Deployment
- Runs on consumer hardware (laptop, mini-PC)
- UI/UX dashboard served via Plotly Dash web app (localhost or network)
- Optional desktop deployment using Electron or similar wrappers

## Security & Privacy
- Local data encryption
- User authentication for dashboard access

## Extensibility
- Modular design for adding new features (e.g., multi-class detection, cloud sync)
- Dash components and callbacks allow rapid UI/UX prototyping and extension
- YOLOv11 supports transfer learning and custom model training

## Coding Best Practices & Rules

1. **Modular Design**
   - Organize code into clear, reusable modules (e.g., detection, tracking, UI, logging).
   - Separate business logic from UI/UX code.
2. **Consistent Naming**
   - Use descriptive, consistent variable and function names (e.g., snake_case for Python).
   - Follow PEP8 style guide for Python code.
3. **Documentation**
   - Document all functions, classes, and modules with docstrings.
   - Maintain up-to-date README and architecture docs.
4. **Error Handling**
   - Use try/except blocks for robust error handling, especially for I/O and model inference.
   - Log errors and exceptions for debugging.
5. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for core logic (detection, counting, data logging).
   - Use pytest or unittest for Python testing.
6. **Version Control**
   - Use Git for source control; commit early and often with clear messages.
   - Branch for features, fixes, and experiments.
7. **Configuration Management**
   - Store configuration parameters in YAML/JSON files or environment variables.
   - Avoid hardcoding values in code.
8. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile code and optimize bottlenecks (e.g., frame processing, model inference).
   - Use batch processing or async where appropriate.
9. **Security & Privacy**
   - Encrypt sensitive data and logs.
   - Validate user input in UI/UX components.
10. **Extensibility**
    - Design for easy addition of new features (e.g., multi-class detection, cloud sync).
    - Use clear interfaces and callbacks for UI/UX modules.
