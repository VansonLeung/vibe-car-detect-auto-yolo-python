# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name
Road Car Traffic Counter / Detection System

## Purpose
Enable real-time detection and counting of vehicles on roads using a USB camera or standard webcam as the input source. The system provides traffic analytics for urban planning, congestion monitoring, and smart city applications.

## Target Users
- City traffic management authorities
- Urban planners
- Researchers studying traffic patterns
- Smart city solution providers

## Key Features
1. **Camera Input**: Support for USB cameras and standard webcams.
2. **Real-Time Car Detection**: Use pre-trained object detection models (YOLO, SSD, etc.) to identify vehicles in video frames.
3. **Counting Logic**: Track and count vehicles as they cross a virtual line or region in the frame.
4. **Live Visualization**: Display video with detection overlays and real-time counts.
5. **Data Logging**: Store traffic counts and optionally save detection logs or annotated frames.
6. **Configurable Regions**: Allow users to set detection zones and counting lines.
7. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure smooth operation on consumer hardware.

## Success Metrics
- Detection accuracy ≥ 90% in typical daylight conditions
- Real-time processing (≥ 15 FPS on standard hardware)
- Reliable counting with <5% error rate

## Assumptions
- Camera is positioned to clearly view the road segment
- Sufficient lighting for detection
- Standard consumer hardware is available

## Constraints
- Limited by camera resolution and frame rate
- Environmental factors (rain, fog, night) may affect accuracy

## Out of Scope
- License plate recognition
- Vehicle speed estimation
- Multi-class vehicle classification (beyond car detection)

## User Stories
- As a traffic manager, I want to see real-time vehicle counts on a dashboard.
- As a planner, I want to download daily traffic logs for analysis.
- As a researcher, I want to configure detection zones for different study areas.

## Technical Requirements
- Python, OpenCV, pre-trained detection models
- USB camera/webcam
- Local storage for logs

## Risks
- False positives/negatives in detection
- Hardware compatibility issues
- Environmental interference

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multi-class vehicle detection
- Cloud-based analytics dashboard
- Integration with traffic signal systems
