## Brainstorming Output
### Ideas
1. Use AI-based models (YOLO, SSD) for robust car detection
2. Implement multi-zone counting for intersections
3. Add weather adaptation (e.g., fog, rain detection)
4. Integrate with city traffic management systems
5. Provide mobile app for remote monitoring
6. Use edge computing for real-time analytics
7. Enable cloud sync for historical data analysis
8. Add vehicle classification (car, truck, bike) as future enhancement
9. Use solar-powered cameras for remote locations
10. Gamify dashboard for citizen engagement

### Challenges
